WITH GREAR POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY  
Debugging  involves finding and resolving bugs, which are defects or problems that prevent the  
correct operation of computer programs, software, or systems.  

Debugging Techniques:  
Interactive Debugging: Using tools to interact with the running program to find issues.  
Control Flow Analysis: Examining the flow of the program to detect logic errors.  
Unit Testing: Testing individual units or components of the software.  
Integration Testing: Testing combined parts of an application to determine if they function together correctly.  
Log File Analysis: Reviewing log files generated by applications to trace back the cause of errors.  
Memory Dumps: Analyzing the contents of memory at the time of a crash to find clues about the bug.  
Profiling: Measuring the space or time complexity of a program, often used to identify performance issues.  

Debugging Tools:  
Debuggers: Specialized programs that help developers in debugging. They can step through code, inspect variables, and control the execution flow.  
Etymology:  
The term “bug” and “debugging” are often attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. The story goes that a moth causing a malfunction was found in a computer, leading to the term “debugging” the system.
